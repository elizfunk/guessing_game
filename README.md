# guessing_game
Hi!  This guessing game is just for practice.

Note that the hint feature adds a new <h3> element to the DOM and adds a new class to the <html> element.

Features have been added to notify a player if his or her guess is a duplicate.  The player is also notified when he or she has run out of guesses, and the game is over.

Thanks for stopping by.
